# Implementing-Recursion-in-Python
Python also supports function recursion, which allows a defined function to call itself. Recursion is a mathematical and programming concept that is widely used. It denotes that a function invokes itself. This has the advantage of allowing you to loop through data to achieve a result. The developer should exercise extreme caution when using recursion because it is very easy to write a function that never terminates or consumes excessive amounts of memory or processor power. When written correctly, recursion, on the other hand, can be a very efficient and mathematically elegant approach to programming.
